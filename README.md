# labels-section-ui-tweak-plugin

The plugin provides for a simple UI tweak that duplicates the labels section so that it can also be accessed from
the top of the content instead of just at its bottom. The plugin is meant for use with Atlassian Confluence.

## How Does it Work?

The plugin will run a JQuery script that will duplicate an existing labels section and insert that duplicate right
in front of the main content element.

## Usage

Install and enjoy.

## How to Build

You can build this yourself, but first you have to install the Atlassian SDK.
Using ``atlas-run`` allows you to try out the plugin locally.
